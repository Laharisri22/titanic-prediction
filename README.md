# Titanic Survival Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, gender, class, and fare.

This project is designed for beginners to understand the basic steps involved in machine learning, including data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
